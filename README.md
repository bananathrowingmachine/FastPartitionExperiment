Astronomically fast partition
=

This is an astronomically fast partition algorithm. Partition is defined on page 405 of the pdf linked below.
A lot of credit goes to Jeff Erickson, author of https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/Algorithms-JeffE.pdf, a free online textbook for my university algorithms class.

The overall idea of this algorithm is that it takes the best parts of a dynamic programming algorithm and a recursive algorithm, combines them together, then does a ton of insane math to speed things up even further.
I subdivided the explanation into the documents so people can therefore be directed to what they're most interested it.

I wrote this in python as it's fairly easy to understand what's going on in that language, especially to outsiders.
